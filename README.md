# DocAdd means Doctor Address 
This was a 2nd-semester group project led by me.
DocAdd is a Tkinter-based  very basic beginner-level GUI where the user puts the specialty of a doctor and selects a city and she/he will get
the list of doctors with schedule and address.
Our App is basically for helping newcomers in a city, they have no idea about good doctors and hospitals, and using this app will greatly help them.

This App is in a very beginner state where it covers only two cities Palakkad and Kanjikode, and up to 6 specialties.
I have to develop it at very large scale and add lots of features like images, reviews, etc.
